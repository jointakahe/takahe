* Posts with content warnings and visibilities including a local-only option
* Creating polls on posts
* Editing post content
* Viewing images, videos and other post attachments
* Uploading images and attaching image captions
* Replies, loading reply threads, boosts and likes
* Following, blocking, muting, and disabling boosts from specific users
* Mentioned, liked, boosted and followed notifications
* Following and unfollowing, and you-were-followed notifications
* Home, local, federated, user, and hashtag timelines
* Full profile pages with images, metadata and links
* RSS feeds for users' public posts
* Custom emoji support
* Searching for users, hashtags and posts by URL
* Multiple domain support
* Multiple identity support (per user account)
* Moderation report system and queue
