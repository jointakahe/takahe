A *beta* Fediverse server for microblogging. Not fully polished yet -
we're still working towards a 1.0!

**Current version: [0.9](https://docs.jointakahe.org/en/latest/releases/0.9/)**

Key features:

- **Multiple domain support**, allowing you to host as many domains as you like on a single running instance.
- **Multiple identity support**, allowing users to represent themselves in as many different ways as they want.
- **Easy deployment and maintenance**, so you can focus on looking after your community rather than trying to wrangle with the software.
- **Mastodon Client API compatible**, so users can use their favourite client apps just as they would with Mastodon or other compatible servers.
