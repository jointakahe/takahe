Features
========

Takahē is currently in development, so it does not yet have all the features
of a full ActivityPub server.

Currently, it supports:

* Web UI only (but can be installed as a PWA)
* Creating, editing and deleting posts, with CWs/summaries and visibility
* Receiving and showing images on posts (cannot be added to posts yet)
* Handling replies and reply threading
* Creating and receiving boosts and likes
* Delivering mentions, and notifications for incoming mentions
* Following and unfollowing, and you-were-followed notifications
* Post visibilities, including a local-only option
* A home timeline, a local timeline, and a federated timeline
* Profile pages with bios, icons, and header images
* Searching for users by exact handle
* Multiple domain support
* Multiple identity (per user account support)
* Server defederation (blocking)
* Signup flow
* Password reset flow

Features planned for releases up to 1.0:

* Adding images to posts, with descriptions
* A mode where followers must be approved
* Emoji fetching and display
* Emoji creation at server level
* Searching for hashtags
* Server announcements system
* Moderation flagging system and queue
* IP and email domain banning
* Mastodon-compatible client API for use with apps
* RSS feeds for users' public posts

Features that may make it into 1.0, or might be further out:

* Creating polls on posts, and handling received polls
* Filter system for Home timeline
* Hashtag trending system with moderation
* Mastodon-compatible account migration target/source
* Relay support

Features on the long-term roadmap:

* "Since you were gone" optional algorithmic timeline
* Seamless transfer from a Mastodon installation
