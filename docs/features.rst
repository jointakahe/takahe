Features
========

Takahē is currently in development, so it does not yet have all the features
of a full ActivityPub server.

Currently, it supports:

* A web UI (which can be installed as a PWA as well)
* Mastodon-compatible client applications (beta support)
* Posts with content warnings and visibilities including a local-only option
* Editing post content
* Viewing images, videos and other post attachments
* Uploading images and attaching image captions
* Replies, loading reply threads, boosts and likes
* Following, blocking, muting, and disabling boosts from specific users
* Mentioned, liked, boosted and followed notifications
* Following and unfollowing, and you-were-followed notifications
* Home, local, federated, user, and hashtag timelines
* Full profile pages with images, metadata and links
* RSS feeds for users' public posts
* Custom emoji support
* Searching for users, hashtags and posts by URL
* Multiple domain support
* Multiple identity support (per user account)
* Moderation report system and queue
* Server announcements system
* Server defederation (blocking)
* Signup flow, including auto-cap by user numbers and invite system
* Password reset via email

Features planned for releases up to 1.0:

* Video upload support
* Hashtag explore page/API
* Handling received polls and voting on them
* Manual approval of followers
* IP and email domain banning
* Two-factor authentication (TOTP and WebAuthn)
* Metadata verification support

* Lists
* Scheduling posts
* Mastodon-compatible account migration target/source
* Relay support

Features on the long-term roadmap:
